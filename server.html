	Following the release of Minecraft 1.16, we have opened the <b>Existence Community Server</b><br />
	The Community Server is new home of Existence SMP, since 2016 our community has grown beyond what anyone of us could have imagined and so the Community Server was opened for a new era of Existence<br />
	<br />
	While it is a Community Server, it will remain whitelisted and is not public. Only trusted members of the community including legacy members, patrons, and known players will be whitelisted on the server. If you are interested in joining, feel free to make yourself known in our <a href="https://existencesmp.com/discord" target="_blank">Discord</a> server and have a chat to our members and admins.<br />
	<br />
	The server is running <b>Minecraft 1.16</b> vanilla, we plan to run the server on <a href="https://papermc.io/" target="_blank">PaperMC</a> when it and our plugins have been updated<br />
